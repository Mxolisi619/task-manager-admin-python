# Task Manager CLI (Python)

A command-line-based task management system developed in Python. This program allows an admin user to register other users, assign tasks, and generate task statistics.
Regular users can log in, view, and manage their own tasks.

## Features
- User Login System (credentials stored securely in a text file)
- Admin-only (User Registration)
- Task Assignment & Storage
- Task Viewing (all tasks or only user-specific)
- Statistics Reporting (admin only)
- Validation checks on usernames and passwords

# How to Run
Link to repo : https://github.com/Mxolisi619/task-manager-admin-python
Run the program:
python task_manager.py

Make sure user.txt and tasks.txt are in the same directory (these files will be created on first use if not present).

Example Usernames (for Testing)

Username: admin

Password: Admin@123 (or whatever you set)

Skills Demonstrated
- Python CLI interaction
- File I/O
- Input validation using re (regex)
- User authentication & access control
- Modular code design with clear logic

## About the Project
- This project was completed as part of the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp to demonstrate command-line application building, file handling, and basic logic structures
in Python.
